## Stocks for Beginners

<b>How to tell the trends of a stock graph?</b>

Graphs for stocks can differ from stock to stock, whether it goes up, down, or stays on a steady trend. Stocks that move up over a period of time with a series of higher highs and higher lows are essentially in uptrends; stocks that move down with lower highs and lower lows over a period of time are in downtrends.

<b>When do I buy?</b>

The period after any correction or crash has historically been a great time for investors to buy at bargain prices. You typically want to buy low and sell high in order to gain maximum profit.

<b>When do I sell?</b>

When the price of a stock reaches a level that cannot be justified by even the best estimates of future business performance, it could be a good time to sell your shares. You typically want to sell your stocks when the price you bought it for raised, therefore you would be making profit and gaining money when you sell it. 

<b>What is averaging up?</b>

Average up refers to the process of buying additional shares of a stock one already owns, but at a higher price. Averaging up can be an attractive strategy to take advantage of momentum in a rising market or where an investor believes a stock’s price will rise.

<b>What is averaging down?</b>

Averaging down is an investment strategy that involves adding to an existing position when its price drops a lot. This technique can be useful when carefully applied with other components of a sound investing strategy.
